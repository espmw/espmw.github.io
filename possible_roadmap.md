- API 
 - consume nextbus API data polling 3 consecutive stop groupings to determine the speed the bus takes to traverse
 that speed
    - fools goal: archive historical data
        - its thus bc: from walks, some nodes have different significance than others but not archieving the whole network, i lose the nodes that can have different significances (ie: a bus stop in between two significant stops can detect cases of bottlenecks [i need
        a special data structure that allows only write on change but this wont solve the problem of querying nextbus])

 -- api that returns said speed and historical
